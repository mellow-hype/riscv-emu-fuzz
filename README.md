Following along with gamozolab's [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM3s8-umRO0) on fuzzing with emulators. This is a Go version of the risc-v emulator created in the video series. It is still incomplete but the basic emulator instance and memory management system (read/write/permissions) have been implemented.

The original Rust code can be found at at [gamozolabs/fuzzing_with_emus](https://github.com/gamozolab/fuzzing_with_emus).
